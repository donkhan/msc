This paragraph will have a hanging indent. Of course, to really see the effect, your paragraph should be a bit longer than this example.
The above CSS trick works for things like bibliographies and footnotes where the hanging indent is part of the same paragraph as the rest of the text. However, if you only want the first line to be hanging, and a separate paragraph below to be indented, HTML already provides a built-in facility to do this. You don't need to resort to CSS sleight-of-hand to produce the effect.
