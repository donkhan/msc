No of Relations from Set A to Set B:
	No of elements in A = m
	No of elements in B = n
		Total No of Relations from Set A to B is pow(2,mn)


Number of Reflexive Relations on a set with n elements : pow(2,n(n-1))

Number of Symmetric Relations on a set with n elements : pow(2,n(n+1)/2)

Number of Anti-Symmetric Relations on a set with n elements: pow(2,n)*pow(3,n(n-1)/2)

Number of Asymmetric Relations on a set with n elements : pow(3,n(n-1)/2)

Irreflexive Relations on a set with n elements : pow(2,n(n-1))

Reflexive and symmetric Relations on a set with n elements : pow(2,n(n-1)/2)


Let |X| = m and |Y| = n

No. of functions f:X->Y is |Y|^|X| = n^m = 3^5 = 243.
